** THIS DOC IS A WIP **


mediapipe issues - wrong timestamp
    -move mediapipe interface to background service so the timestamp is never lost
        -yes, could be solved by fixing the class to persist timestamp, but no point because we are moving to a service anyway for other reasons
        

SOLVED - mobile communication - can't connect without wifi
    -try to run network extension app and proxy on vuzix blade to connect vuzix directly to mobile compute
    -use Onplus7T hotspot and find IP on wearnet
        -code right now is asking WIFI for our IP address - need to figure out what it is on local hotspot (maybe there is a function in android to get IP address regardless of source)
    -use S7 as router
    -only demo at home for now

IMPORTANT - mobile compute can't run without application window open
    -switch to always on background service
    
Vuzix battery issues - one hour battery not long enough
    -wear 100Wh battery pack connected through shirt to vuzix
        -should run for multiple days
    -fix the battery draining software
        - switch from single camaera snapshot to video
            -grab intermittent frames and send with current socket system
            -if possible, also record video at 1080p 24fps on the device
            -test speed of transer - maybe send at 720p/640/480/less than original to mobile compute



## TODO

#### Low level
- get running on pocket worn SBC with bluetooth headset microphone and speaker
- add VAD (voice activity detection) to voice command so we don't waste our time, bandwidth, and money transcribing non-speech
    - Google webRTC VAD is one of the best and well supported for python 4 : https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad
- multiple people running through WearableAI mediapipe graph
- stream video + audio from ASG to GLBOX

#### High level
- add "mountain bike mode"
- life live captions
    - live NLP
- personal person database on GLBOX
    - facial recognition 
- advance memory extension system on GLBOX
    - video + audio saving
    - natural language recall
    - memory database

## Improve
-get good open source TTS running
    -coqui tts works great but can we get it running in a script real time on the GPU?
    -other faster option?
